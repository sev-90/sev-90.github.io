Project \#1: Crops disease type prediction with Convolutional neural network (CNN)

This project stemmed from my participation in the [ICLR Workshop Challenge CGIAR: Computer Vision for Crop Disease](https://zindi.africa/competitions/iclr-workshop-challenge-1-cgiar-computer-vision-for-crop-disease/data) in 2020.

This project addresses the devastating impact of wheat rust on African crops by developing a machine learning model to classify crops as healthy, suffering from stem rust, or affected by leaf rust. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the fastai library, the model is trained on imagery data collected from Ethiopia, Tanzania, and public sources. The training pipeline involves \textbf{data inspection, cleaning, augmentation, transfer learning with ResNet34, progressive image resizing, and model re-training}. Key techniques include identifying and correcting mislabeled images, augmenting the small dataset to enhance generalization, and progressively resizing images to improve accuracy. The final model achieves a loss of 0.3758 on the test set. 

The training process begins with inspecting \textbf{876 labeled samples and 610 unlabeled test samples}, followed by data cleaning to remove or relabel misclassified images. \textbf{Data augmentation applies transformations like flipping, rotation, and lighting adjustments to prevent overfitting}. Transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet34 model enhances feature extraction, and progressive image resizing (from 128x128 to 256x256) improves performance. The \textbf{model undergoes additional fine-tuning by retraining on samples with high prediction loss}. The classifierâ€™s accuracy is monitored through error rate metrics, achieving the best possible result using optimized hyperparameters.
