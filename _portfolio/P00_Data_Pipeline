abstract: "This project demonstrates the use of a **modern data engineering stack** to design and deploy an **end-to-end data workflow**, covering the full lifecycle from **ETL/ELT processing** to **data visualization**.  

- **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)** provisions core GCP resources, including a **Virtual Machine**, a **Cloud Storage bucket** (data lake), and a **BigQuery data warehouse**.  
- **Apache Spark** is used for large-scale data exploration and processing.  
- **Apache Airflow** (via Docker Compose) to orchestrate the ETL workflows.
