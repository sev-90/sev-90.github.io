abstract: "This project demonstrates the use of a modern data engineering stack to design and deploy an end-to-end data workflow, 
covering the full lifecycle from ETL/ELT processing to data visualization.  
(1) Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) provisions core GCP resources, including a Virtual Machine, a Cloud Storage bucket (data lake), and 
a BigQuery data warehouse, (2) Apache Spark is used for large-scale data exploration and processing, (3) Apache Airflow (via Docker Compose)
to orchestrate the ETL workflows, (4) dbt Cloud for constructing modular SQL-based data transformations, and (5) Google Looker Studio 
for intuitive dashboards and interactive visualizations. "
