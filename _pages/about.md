I'm Sevin Mohammadi, a civil engineer and a data scientist. I grew up in Ardabil 🏡, a picturesque town in northwestern Iran, nestled between Mount Sabalan 🗻 and the Caspian Sea 🌊 , surrounded by the scenic Heyran Road 🏞 🍃, hazelnut forests 🌳 🌰, and natural hot springs ♨ 🏊‍♀️.

To pursue my dreams, I first moved to Tehran for my undergraduate and graduate studies and later to the United States 🌎 to further continue my graduate education 📚. I earned a master’s degree in Engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, followed by a PhD from the Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics Department at Columbia University. I successfully defended my PhD dissertation, "Geospatial Probabilistic Machine Learning for Analyzing Urban Vehicular Mobility Patterns with Decision-Making Applications," in December 2024 👩‍🎓 🥳.

As a civil engineer 👷‍♀️, I am deeply committed to shaping the \textbf{future of smart transportation and cities}. As a data scientist 👩‍💻, I harness the power of data analytics and state-of-the-art machine learning models to develop innovative solutions that drive meaningful impact. My work focuses on transforming complex data into actionable insights, and I have conducted numerous impactful applied research projects at the intersection of these fields, showcasing what technology can achieve in \textbf{advancing urban mobility and infrastructure}.
