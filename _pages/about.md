I'm Sevin Mohammadi, a civil engineer and a data scientist. I grew up in Ardabil 🏡, a honey city in northwestern Iran 🍯🐝, nestled between Mount Sabalan 🗻 and the Caspian Sea 🌊 , surrounded by the scenic Heyran Road 🏞 🍃, hazelnut forests 🌳 🌰, and has lots of natural hot springs ♨ 🏊‍♀️ all of which shaped many of my cherished childhood memories.

To pursue my dreams, I first moved to Tehran for my undergraduate and graduate studies and later to the United States to further continue my graduate education 📚. I earned a master’s degree in Engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, followed by a PhD from the Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics Department at Columbia University in the City of New York 🗽. I successfully defended my PhD dissertation, "Geospatial Probabilistic Machine Learning for Analyzing Urban Vehicular Mobility Patterns with Decision-Making Applications," in December 2024 👩‍🎓 🥳.

Soon, I will be moving to beautiful lakeside Evanston, IL, for an exciting new chapter 🤩, and I am actively exploring opportunities in the Greater Chicago area 🌬😸.

As an engineer and data scientist👷‍♀️👩‍💻, I leverage problem-solving expertise, advanced analytics, and state-of-the-art machine learning models to develop innovative, impactful solutions. My work focuses on transforming complex data into actionable insights, and I have led numerous high-impact applied research projects at the intersection of engineering, data science, and AI, demonstrating the transformative potential of technology.
