I'm Sevin Mohammadi, a **data engineer and scientist**. I grew up in the honey city 🍯🐝, nestled between Mount Sabalan 🗻 and the Caspian Sea 🌊 , surrounded by the scenic green Heyran Road 🏞 🍃, hazelnut forests 🌳 🌰, and has lots of natural hot springs ♨ 🏊‍♀️ all of which shaped many of my cherished childhood memories.

To pursue my dreams, I moved to the United States to continue my graduate education. I earned a master’s degree in **Transportaion Engineering** from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, followed by a PhD in engineering with **Smart Cities** focus from the Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics Department at **Columbia University in the City of New York**. I successfully defended my PhD dissertation, "Geospatial Probabilistic Machine Learning for Analyzing Urban Vehicular Mobility Patterns with Decision-Making Applications," in December 2024.


As a ** data engineer and scientist**, I leverage **data engineering technology stack**, **problem-solving expertise**, **advanced analytics**, **statistical analysis**, and **state-of-the-art machine learning** models to develop **innovative, impactful data-driven solutions**. My work focuses on transforming complex data into actionable insights, and I have led numerous **high-impact applied research projects** at the intersection of data engineering, data science, and AI, demonstrating the transformative potential of technology. One of my proudest projects was [Optimizing FDNY Ambulance Response in NYC](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/about/news/optimizing-fdny-ambulance-response), where I developed a data-driven approach to improve emergency dispatch efficiency and reduce response times in collaboration with the FDNY data analytics and Columbia operation research teams.

I am based in Evanston, IL and currently exploring opportunities across the Greater Chicago area.
