I'm Sevin Mohammadi, a civil engineer and a data scientist. I grew up in Ardabil 🏡, a honey city in northwestern Iran 🍯🐝, nestled between Mount Sabalan 🗻 and the Caspian Sea 🌊 , surrounded by the scenic Heyran Road 🏞 🍃, hazelnut forests 🌳 🌰, and has lots of natural hot springs ♨ 🏊‍♀️ all of which shaped many of my cherished childhood memories.

To pursue my dreams, I first moved to Tehran for my undergraduate and graduate studies and later to the United States to further continue my graduate education 📚. I earned a master’s degree in **Transportaion Science** from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, followed by a PhD in **Smart Cities** from the Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics Department at **Columbia University in the City of New York** 🗽. I successfully defended my PhD dissertation, "Geospatial Probabilistic Machine Learning for Analyzing Urban Vehicular Mobility Patterns with Decision-Making Applications," in December 2024 👩‍🎓 🥳.

This Fall, I will be moving to beautiful lakeside Evanston, IL, for an exciting new chapter 🤩, and I am actively exploring opportunities in the Greater Chicago area.

As an engineer and data scientist👷‍♀️👩‍💻, I leverage **problem-solving expertise**, **advanced analytics**, **statistical analysis**, and **state-of-the-art machine learning** models to develop **innovative, impactful solutions**. My work focuses on transforming complex data into actionable insights, and I have led numerous **high-impact applied research projects** at the intersection of engineering, data science, and AI, demonstrating the transformative potential of technology. One of my proudest projects was [Optimizing FDNY Ambulance Response in NYC](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/about/news/optimizing-fdny-ambulance-response), where I developed a data-driven approach to improve emergency dispatch efficiency and reduce response times in collaboration with the FDNY data analytics and Columbia operation research teams.
