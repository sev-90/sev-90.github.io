I am a PhD candidate in Civil Engineering & Engineering Mechanics Department at Columbia University, advised by [Prof. Andrew W. Smyth](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty-staff/directory/andrew-w-smyth). My thesis focuses on ``Probabilistic Machine Learning for Travel Time and Trajectory Modeling and Decision-making." As a research assistant at the [The Center for Smart Streetscapes (CS3)](https://cs3-erc.org/), I develope data analytics and machine learning solutions to address mobility & operational challenges in urban road networks. 

Prior to this, I was a research assistant at the Center for Transportation Research (CTR) at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, during my Master's study. During my time at CTR, I concentrated on the statistical analysis of human driving behavior.
