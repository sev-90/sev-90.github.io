I'm Sevin Mohammadi, a **Data Engineer and Scientist**. I grew up in the honey city 🍯🐝, nestled between Mount Sabalan 🗻 and the Caspian Sea 🌊 , surrounded by the scenic green Heyran Road 🏞 🍃, hazelnut trees 🌳 🌰, and has lots of natural hot springs ♨ 🏊‍♀️, all of which shaped many of my cherished childhood memories.

I moved to the United States to pursue my dreams and continue my graduate education. I earned a master’s in **Transportation Engineering** from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, followed by a PhD in engineering with a **Smart Cities** focus from the Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics Department at **Columbia University in the City of New York**. I successfully defended my PhD dissertation, "Geospatial Probabilistic Machine Learning for Analyzing Urban Vehicular Mobility Patterns with Decision-Making Applications," in December 2024. Soon after, I was promoted to **Staff Associate II** in the [Center for Smart Streetscapes at Columbia University](https://cs3-erc.org/). 


As a **data engineer and scientist**, I leverage a **modern data engineering stack**, **problem-solving expertise**, **advanced analytics**, **statistical methods**, and state-of-the-art **machine learning models** to build **innovative, impactful data-driven solutions**. My work focuses on transforming complex data into actionable insights, and I have designed and deployed multiple **end-to-end data pipelines** for high-impact applied research projects at the intersection of data engineering, data science, and AI—demonstrating the transformative potential of technology. One of my proudest projects was [Optimizing FDNY Ambulance Response in NYC](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/about/news/optimizing-fdny-ambulance-response), where I developed a data-driven approach to improve emergency dispatch efficiency and reduce response times in collaboration with the FDNY data analytics and Columbia operation research teams.
