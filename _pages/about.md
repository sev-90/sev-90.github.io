I am a PhD candidate in Columbia University's Civil Engineering & Engineering Mechanics Department, advised by [Prof. Andrew W. Smyth](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty-staff/directory/andrew-w-smyth). My PhD thesis is Probabilistic Machine Learning for Travel Time and Trajectory Modeling and Decision-making. I work as a research assistant in the [The Center for Smart Streetscapes (CS3)](https://cs3-erc.org/), where I find data analytics and machine learning-enabled solutions for mobility & operation challenges in urban road networks. 

Prior to this, I was a research assistant at the Center for Transportation Research (CTR) at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, advised by [Prof. Asad Khattak](https://cee.utk.edu/people/asad-khattak/) during my Master's study. During my time at CTR, I focused on the statistical analysis of human driving behavior.
